            "description": "<p>Conveniently located just two miles from the city centre, Mount Pleasant Square is situated on the edge of Ranelagh Village which is well served by an abundance of amenities both social and essential including fashionable shops, bars, delicatessens and restaurants. The locality is well served by public transport with the nearest Luas station at Ranelagh Village; just a few minutes&#39; walk from the front door. Some of the city&#39;s premier schools are located in the immediate vicinity with St Stephens Green less than 2km away or a brisk 15 minute stroll. The location simply couldn&#39;t be better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ucked in off Ranelagh Road, No. 48 Mount Pleasant Square is an imposing, double fronted family home with instant curb appeal. The two storey over garden level property has been re-designed, refurbished and extended to provide region 2,360sqft of beautifully appointed accommodation with every conceivable modern comfort and all the Georgian period character you might expect from a property of this ilk. From the moment you step up onto the granite steps and through the hall door the instant impression is of an abundance of light and space. From here there are reception rooms either side of the entrance hallway and a view right though the kitchen cum breakfast room to the 70ft south facing rear garden. Outside there is a large sandstone patio / terrace between the main house and the lawn. Surrounded by 100 year old stone walls the garden faces directly south and offers lots of space for outdoor activities for busy children or family barbeques for the adults when the summer finally arrives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Living room enjoys a dual aspect with natural light pouring through from sun up to sun down. At the focal point of the room is an original fireplace &amp; surround. The re-framed and restored sash windows, plaster detail and wooden floors complete the d&eacute;cor in the main reception room. This high quality finish and attention to detail is obvious throughout this substantial family home, with the open plan kitchen, dining and breakfast room adding more of a modern twist to the accommodation at hall level. There are two sets of French doors from the extended breakfast room which does a lot to connect the private and surprisingly large south facing garden to the internal living space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upstairs there are two very large double rooms and the main bathroom. The master bedroom has the added benefit of a walk through wardrobe and en suite bathroom which overlooks the garden. The additional bedrooms are situated at the garden level complete with a shower room. One or both of the rooms at ground floor level could be used as a den/playroom or home office which has become a must have in 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Property Features</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Stunning Location Overlooking Mount Pleasant Square &amp; Tennis Club</li>\r\n\t<li>Bright, Elegant Accommodation Extending to Approximately 220sqm/2,360sqft.</li>\r\n\t<li>Large South Facing Rear Garden with Terrace</li>\r\n\t<li>New Double Glazed Sash Windows Throughout</li>\r\n\t<li>New Timber Flooring Throughout</li>\r\n\t<li>Beautiful Period Features</li>\r\n\t<li>BER Exempt</li>\r\n\t<li>Security Alarm System</li>\r\n\t<li>Gas Fired Central Heating</li>\r\n</ul>",
