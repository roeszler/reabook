* Repository link : https://github.com/roeszler/reabook
* Terminal : https://reabook.herokuapp.com/


## 1. Project Purpose

It is a.... application presenting the use of a Full Stack Framework... , which runs in the [Code Institutes](https://codeinstitute.net/) python terminal deployed [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/platform).
* Users can select and submit orders for the N3D product range of printed foot insoles produced at [northotics.com](https://northotics.com/shop/semi-customised-orthosis/n3d/). 
* Users can create, retrieve and navigate through orders to update information, check production status and/or re-order products.

## 2. Agile Development Process

This project (SpaceScope) has been developed following an Agile methodology. As part of the assessment process at the [Code Institutes](https://codeinstitute.net/) - [Full Stack development program](https://codeinstitute.net/se/full-stack-software-development-diploma/). 

SpaceScope has not been created within a team, rather the efforts of the main author, [Stuart Roeszler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stuartroeszler/). As such some of the project management processes such as [team velocity](#team-velocity) and [information radiators](#information-radiators) are outlined only, however would form a crucial part of a live, team based project.
