## 1. Project Purpose

ReaBook (the Site) is a theoretical real estate management site that is used to present the deployment of a Appointment booking system (the App) using a Full Stack Framework.

Both runs within the [Code Institutes](https://codeinstitute.net/) python terminal deployed [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/platform).
* Users can select and submit requests to attend store owner users arranged viewing times for properties listed for sale or rent.
* Users can create, retrieve and navigate through orders to update information, check production status and/or re-book properties.
* Business owner users can list, edit and advertise times for potential customers to view properties currently for sale or rent in their business portfolio.

[A live version of the app can be accessed here](https://reabook.herokuapp.com/)

ReaBook (the Business) is a theoretical business in the real estate services industry, matching properties for sale or rent (including office and private living spaces) to those looking for a property solution. It's simple business premise is to collate and extend the versatility of the property seeking and viewing process. 

The site is a business promoter and the app is an Appointment Manager for property inspections.

## 2. Agile Development Process

This project (ReaBook) has been developed following an Agile methodology. As part of the assessment process at the [Code Institutes](https://codeinstitute.net/) - [Full Stack development program](https://codeinstitute.net/se/full-stack-software-development-diploma/). 

ReaBook has not been created within a team, rather the efforts of single student developer; [Stuart Roeszler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stuartroeszler/). As such some of the project management processes such as [team velocity](#team-velocity) and [information radiators](#information-radiators) are outlined only, however would form a crucial part of a live, team based project.
