## Strategy : B2C Research 
  * often with B2C, it's a simple emotional transaction.
  * don't generally visit the site that often
  * possibly more of an impulse buy
  * often not process behind purchase
  * Single person involved

## Emotional Triggers:
### What are the feelings that the product or service gives the consumer which leads them to complete a purchase? 
  * B2C - Branding is a huge factor
  * Pricing generally transparent:
  * All users are charged the same price (unless discount codes available).
  * Shipping fees are often expected
  * Up-selling / cross-selling expected

## Potential B2C User Interviews / Research
### What makes a good [………] experience? ie: video streaming experience? flight booking experience? e-commerce experience?

### When you go to a [………] site, where do you go first?

### Why do you go there in particular?

### What would you put off doing when you got there?

### Why do you put it off?

### How often do you visit the application?

### How often do you use it?

### What do you most use it for?

### What do you typically do before using the product?

### What do you typically do after using the product?


## Strategy : Product Considerations 

### B2C
#### Content Strategy: 
  * catchy and compelling headlines
  * content not overloaded
  * Minimal large emotive images + Logo
  * Clear space
  * B2C space is crowded with competitors
  * uniqueness
  * standing out has value
  * Minimal steps from click to buy to payment
  * Three steps max

### B2B
#### Content Strategy: 
  * Users looking for as much information as possible
  * Purchases almost never on the first visit
  * Lead nurturing important
  * Include compatibility and integration information to assure
  * lots of call to actions (CTA) to create a sense of reliability and assurance:
    * live chat, 
    * phone, 
    * text, 
    * email
  * Content variety
    *  Video tutorials, 
    * white papers (thought leader and authority in this area)
    * blogs, 
    * testimonials, 
    * frequently asked questions,
    * webinars

## Strategy: Tradeoffs

* Tradeoff 1: Importance (UXD Business Goals & User Needs) 
* Tradeoff 2: Viable & Feasible (Can we build a solution given limited time and resources?)

### Whats worth doing?
Create a roadmap that provides value for the users and the business (UXD is driven by business goals and user needs).

### Must Address needs…

### Should Address needs…

### Unwise to invest time in…

### What are we making?

### What Value will it add?

### Target users are? …not you… (research)

### What experiences compels them?

### How is our offer different from competitors / substitutes?

### What does the user expect?


## Best UX (intuitive) = Single Use Learning
### What is this? 

### Is this what I expected to see?

### Does it look credible and trustworthy?

### Does it offer what I want?

### Does it look valuable enough for me to stay?

### Does it look valuable enough for me to return?

### What actions can I take now?

### How do I learn more?

### How do I contact someone?

### Answers available immediately?

### How to tradeoff?

## List opportunities
  * Rate each 1-5 in two dimensions
  * Importance (1-5)
  * Viability & Feasibility [or realistic] (1-5)
  * Map these on a spreadsheet
    * Opportunities / Problem  -  Importance  -  Viability / Feasibility
    * (SUM importance Scores) vs (AVERAGE of viability x no. items)

If they match - can do all items on the list
Map these on the diagram
