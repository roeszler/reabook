# Project X - UCD Scope Plane
Stuart Roeszler - Portfolio Project X

_This section is for display purposes only and has not been completed as parth of CI Project X - Project X. It is included as an initial template only and is intended as a quick refrence for use within projects in the future._

## Plane 2 of 5 - Scope

The Scope refines the trade-off performed at the Strategy level further. It aids to determine what features of those business objectives and user needs are part of the project and those that arent.

A well defined scope uncovers and resolves conflicts early and provides a good picture of the features and the content that's available. In particular Looks for :
     

## Requirements
---
- Useful (to us and/or to the customer)?
- Sellable (can we sell it)?
- Buildable (affordable)?

Objective
- What does the user want to accomplish? 

Functional
- What does the user need to do to reach their objective?
- What is involved?

Non-Functional (ie Content)
- What constraints does the app / site hav to perform within?

The Business rules
- What dynamic constraints do we need to work within (calculations, definitions, legal etc.?)

## Functional specifications__
- Documents what's included and what is excluded for this stage of the project

### The Agile approach 
- committing to small, bite-sized increments of development
- committing to solving a smaller part of the larger problem
- keeping the features simple
- keep the schedule controllable
- setting out key milestones
- __all should align with the strategy!__

### Sprints
A sprint is a duration in time in which you commit to building something, typically a few days / a week. Rarely >1 month
- includes a couple of development days and collaboration
- sequential in nature (Sprint 1, Sprint 2â€¦ ) ie:
- Identifies elements of a good [ business / function / feature].
- Identifies specific good online elements for this project

Identifies what needs to be done now and what can wait
- Too big scope - Unrealistic 
- Too small scope - Unimpressive

__"Scope creep"__ is the addition of features that weren't agreed on at the starting point. 
- Notorious in software development
- Reccomend new ideas for features can be postponed for future releases

### _"Trade-offs are essential to a coherent strategy. They create the need for choice, and they purposefully limit what a company offers"_

Ie:

- Ikea staffing vs intuitive shopping / prices
- The long wow - mall incremental releases that have perceived value


## From why to what - Requirements
---

1. What users and stakeholders say they need
2. What they actually need, and
3. What they don't know they need

- Confident but false assumptions 
- Diff between imagined how it will be used and how actually used.
- Both influenced by emotions and environment

  - What do ppl actually need?

  - Brainstorm (w/ mind mapping)

  - Discuss (hothouse)

## Product Rollout Challenge
--- 

- Assume you will roll your product out over three releases. Your challenge is to determine what features will be made available for each release.

- List all the features of your product

- Give each feature a difficulty level ranging between 1 and 3, with 3 being the maximum difficulty

- Given limited resources, you have a maximum of 12 points to use across the releases. Within these constraints, determine which features for release will provide most value for you and your users.
