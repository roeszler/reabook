## 4 of 5 Planes - Skeleton Plane

The skeleton plane is concerned with navigation design and interface design (features and usefulness). 

Commonly associated as being design work. Interaction design and information architecture from the structure plane feeds into the skeleton plane.

- What form will the application take?
- How will the users get around?
- How do we present the content?

Form to Function

- Rapidly establish value in the user's mind
- Lead the user towards continuing the experience
- Introduce specific content at the most relevant and most appropriate points
- Add immediate value with each tap or click
- Add positivity to the overall experience.

Habits and conventions

- Humans habitual 
- Conventions match expectations 
  - Break conventions only if you can improve on them
- Take advantage of visual expectations

### Progressive disclosure
- give people what they need, when & where they need it

#### For Most users, The UI is the system

Data in three manifestations:

1. Data at rest - in server database [SQL, Python, MySQL, MongoDB]
2. Data in motion - being pulled [Python, Django]
3. Data as presented - via some user interface [CSS, HTML, JavaScript]

---
### UI needs to be well polished, as that is the basis of how users see the system and perceive value.
---

Importance of the interface to user experience - For Most users, The UI is the system.

### Features and Usefulness
- Patterns - usability improves when similar parts are expressed in similar ways
- Progressive Disclosure
  - progressively reveal information over time across space 
- Visual Grouping 
  - visually group elements together (up down, left to right) in order of importance
- More features = Less user-friendly the screen 
  - Hicks-Hyman Law

#### Navigation 
- Browsing 
- Searching
- Using Filters to narrow
- Pagination (moving you from one point of information to the next - ie booking system) + progressive disclosure.
- Representational Icons 

### Metaphors
We use metaphors (words / phrases / symbols / visual representations to represent the meaning of an action / object) to reason and understand the world

- The metaphor for innovation is the lightbulb
- The metaphor for usefulness is a wrench
- Aesthetic is a paintbrush
- Long-lasting is a sturdy house
- Thorough is a list, ... and so on

Very useful in conveying information
- intuitive, 
- obvious, and 
- taken from everyday life

### Information design 

- Should be invisible
- Bad design
  - A form that's difficult to complete, resulting in errors, will annoy a user.
  - Poor instructions that cause frustration or even danger.
  - Poor educational materials that don't promote learning.
  - Poorly represented scientific data that's misinterpreted.
  - Manufacturing UIs that don't warn of potential danger.
  - Websites that are difficult to navigate and unpleasant to look at.
  - Information that isn't relevant to the reason we're here.
- Context and order matter
- Conventions on ordering types of information 

#### Wireframes

- Are used to see how each screen fits into the whole site.
- Determine what links and content is required to meet user needs
- How balanced the elements are
- How elements relate to each other

What do wireframes tell us?
- What gets included, 
- how its organised
- what gets priority
- where elements are located
- where a user can go 
- what users encounter when they get to locations 
- how a user moves through the space of the site itself

Wireframes ask questions such as:
- Have I left anything out?
- Is the top priority content noticed first?

Revisit our strategy and goals.
- Is this valuable?
- Have we got this right?
- If not, then what do we need to revise?
