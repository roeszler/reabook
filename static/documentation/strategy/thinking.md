# Design Thinking
* how to solve complex design problems 

3rd Gen : Stakeholders driving design process


The Design thinking Process: 
Empathy
Defining
Ideate
Prototype 
Test
Storytelling 

### Frustration and Desire: Motivates purchases

Mental Models: 
Preparations to deal with uncertain problems in every day situations. 
What we think is true…

Maslow Hierarchy of needs: view the dissatisfaction with empathy to create opportunity
Self Fulfilment
Psychological
Basic

Goals Based Approach to Design Thinking
Performance Goals
Preference Goals 
Satisfaction Goals

GOALS + NEEDS + MENTAL MODELS = the real hidden story


Avoiding Dissatisfaction Approach:
Identify slow, limited, Unable to, Access, Low quality…
Identify where customers are not feeling valued for their interactions

### Context of Decisions
Event to Resulting action (simple)
Cause to Effect (complicated)
Complexity to Predictive Power 
Chaotic Contexts
VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, Ambiguous) 
How the real world works. 
Non-linear
Non-Human Centred 
Volatile = Increasing change

### Logic 

Inductive Reasoning (from observation set)
Deductive Reasoning (hypothesis that is correct + feature matrix)
Abductive Reasoning (used in design thinking)

Abductive Reasoning (used in design thinking)
Observations may be incomplete 
Most Likely conclusions
Conclusions based on how these line up:
Judgement
Observations 
What we know

### Impact of change

Consideration of changing the world they are in for the better.
Soup Kitchen vs Restaurant

What goals are achieved by using it?


# Design Thinking Process

## Empathy 

Personas:
Realistic and reliable representation of KEY AUDIENCE segment
Focus: 
Needs 
Expectations
Clarify how likely to succeed 

Produces: 
Universal Features
Universal functionality
Describes real life
Backgrounds
Goals 
Values

Formulating Interview Questions 
Define broader themes
Answerable format
Prioritise open ended questions
Care not to influence answer
Time to listen

## Define 

Problem Statement: 

I am a [persona] trying to [verb do something], but there's a [barrier] because there's a [cause] which makes me feel [an emotional reaction].

As a Code Institute student, Stuart Roeszler, I'm  trying to share an example of my code working to another student as I'm not sure it's good,  but I don't know how to share my screen, which makes me feel like technology is not for me.


Interviews 
- Used to gather enough information to help build a problem statement.

Nurture

Body of Interview
Probing / Understanding
All topics covered

Feedback time

## Ideation

Swing to the solutions to well defined personas and problem statements 

Rules: 
One conversation at a time,
Use an online tool where you can be visual,
Encourage wild ideas, don't be afraid to  bring them, just go for it, go for quantity.
Build on the ideas of others. 
Defer judgment.


How to get the person at the back of the room, or the  person in the online session who is really quiet, to move to the front, to bring their ideas forward? There are tools and techniques to do that:

Templates: 
Imagine you’re six
Use a magic wand
Think that your user will love it
Remove the need from the face of the planet
Only be used by a cat - in front stimuli only
How might we…
Share online?
Show code working to someone else?
Make someone more confident with tech?

SCAMPER
Substitute 
Combine 
Adapt 
Modify 
Put to another use
Eliminate
Reverse

Tools: 
Jamboard
Miro
Limnu
Sketchboard
Explain Everything
Heyhi
LucidSpark

Monday
Conceptboard


Finish the right way: 
Make it memorable
Give the session a meaningful name
Come up with the main solutions
Get consensus with majority vote 
Explain how to record something that is unworkable / unhappy with going to prototype

After the meeting:
Commit to next steps 
Focus on priorities
Make sure you answer the goal of the session

## Prototype

Thinking with your hands

Functional Prototypes 
Horizontal Prototypes
Low fidelity 
MVP 
Mock-up
Paper Prototypes
Proof of Concept 
Proof of principle
Rapid Prototyping
Scale Model
Simulations 
Sports Prototype
Static Prototype
Storyboard
Throwaways
Vertical Prototypes
Wireframes
Architectural Animation 
Concept Art
Demo
Evolutionary Prototype
Form Study

How to approach making a prototype:
What could it become?
Choose the type of prototype.
What goal does our user achieve?
Define users goal.
How do we structure something in a way that makes sense?
Information architecture
How can the user achieve their goal?
Create a user journey
What could it look like?
Low-fi wireframe
Do I need to build a whole product?
Keep it simple.
How do I know when one prototype is enough?
Keep it simple.
What if I have chosen the wrong thing to prototype?
Keep it simple.

Goals:
Choose the type of prototype.
Define users goal.
Information architecture
Create a user journey
Low-fi wireframe
Keep it simple
When user achieves their goal, user feedback will point you in the right direction.

Set User goals

Every Screen:
How did I get here?
What do I do?
Where do I go?

People Satisfice = we choose the first reasonable option. Design for this.

Make where to look and where to click obvious

At all times keep in mind that: ‘People are trying to achieve a goal’. 

Visualise User Journey: 

Goal: Ben (a super user) does his weekly review and ‘Big thumbs up’.



Information architecture:
A screen or a series of screens, with everything is in the right place at the right time to help someone achieve a goal.
Product components on cards
Sort the cards and make a stack of those that belong together
Open cards sort: where somebody buys something, or where somebody reviews something… etc
Close cards sort: buckets of ‘Here’s a review’ and ‘Here’s a purchase’ and which cards go into each?

Wireframe: 
Is everything there?
Flow between screens?
Is all info present?
Is all functionality present?
Practice
Your goal is to achieve this…
NOT the steps to perform!

Paper prototype:
Wireframe on paper 
Step out user journey to achieve simple goal
Check screen that all information is present
Check screen that all functionality is present
Make sure the goal can be achieved using the paper prototype

How do we visualise what someone wants to do?* Set a goal
* Think of the steps that they need to achieve that goal
* Work out the architecture that can create those steps
* Draw up the screens that let them do that
Does this prototype give an  answer to your problem statement?
Can you tell the story to someone  when you walk through the screens?
Does the story start with the user having a goal, and in the end a user achieving a goal?

## Test

Usability test session
* How do you know your prototype is any good?
  * Test it on a real user.
How do we know what to test?
Create a hypothesis.
How do we Test?
Undertake guerrilla test.
How can we show the results of our test?
A well structured presentation.


Hypothesis: 

We believe that we've given Ben a chance to interact with his community and encourage people to contribute  their code, when they're trying new things. It will help achieve the fast affirmation, adoption of coding best practice,  and reduce imposter syndrome.

Experiment:

We're going  to build a paper prototype and test how easy it is for a user to rate a story when role playing as Ben.

Quantitative Measurable Outcome: 
The user can achieve their goal less than one minute time on task.
The number of errors the user makes when completing the task.
The user to rate the test level of satisfaction
Qualitative Outcome: 
How do you feel given this feedback?

Usability Tests:
Testing product not abilities
Testing product on users
Goal is to act on user feedback
Not often practised 
75-80% of usability problems 
Tested on user persona

Guerrilla test: A. Moderator to lead the test
B. Observer to record what happens
C. Participant

Consent form
Pre-test questionnaire
Training
Intro script read to participant 
Intro to tasks (hand them the paper) 
Participant performs test
Post-test questionnaire
Debrief and Thanks

Goal
To see how someone would interact with the UI
Requirements: 
Paper / other prototype (laptop, tablet etc)
Facilitator
Note Taker (can be the same if simple test)
Recording session (explicit permission required)
Test Plan:
Consent form
Pre-test questionnaire
Training
Intro script read to participant 
Intro to tasks (hand them the paper) 
Participant performs test
Post-test questionnaire
Debrief and Thanks


Intro Script: 

Where you explain to the person why you need to get their input. 
We're going over some design ideas we want to try to test things out. There are no right and wrong answers, and the person isn't wrong. We want to see the world through your eyes.
The importance of a script means that if you do the test, you're setting it up according to the script.  Everybody who does the test, uses the same script so you know it's been set up the same way. That helps create an even playing field for the testing itself.

Interview: 

Ask somebody about themselves, get them warmed up.
Make sure you're dealing with someone that matches the audience.
Depending on the product you could ask what they do for a living, how often they use computers, etc.

You steer the conversation towards testing the prototype:
Ask to think out loud and say ‘as you go through tell me what you're thinking’.
Give them a goal to reach.
Give Ben a thumbs up to a good comment, that's their goal.
Give out the contribution of the week, and double thumbs up


Now everything is setup for the session.
Give them the prototype 
Observe how they're using the interface.
What are they doing?
Where are they stuck? 
Are they happy completing the task?
Did you see smiles? Or were they annoyed?
Take notes, here and there if you really have to you can ask some questions but better to just sit  back and observe.
Hypothesis,
Evidence of Guerrilla test,
Findings, 
Decide what would you keep,
Decide what would you lose, 
Is this a good idea? or do we need to throw it away?

Goal: Your hypothesis is supported or dismissed.

Avoid Affirmation
Don't brainstorm (never ask to re-design a feature)
Don't test on users not your audience
Don't take too much of users time

## Storytelling

One: the story of the user,  whose challenge you solved.
The other is the story of you as a Design Thinker,
the steps you went through
what you  covered. 
Where were the pain points? What was easy? 
What was difficult? What did you really enjoy?
What would you do next?Why is your idea good for the end user?  
How did it address that key goal?
How did Design Thinking bring you closer to those goals, of solving problems in a way, in aligning your idea on a build with an end user and what  they need to do and going through steps that you can use again and again, both in projects in Code Institute, and beyond to change the world.
Star moment:
Something to always remember.

* Tell them at the start what that moment is going to be,  * Tell them the star moment 
* Recap that at the end.
The 7 Elements of Storytelling

The Plot: what happens in a story.
The Characters: who are involved in your story
A protagonist: the main character or hero, who the audience cares most about
An antagonist: the villain
A confidant: the sidekick or best friend
A foil: the opposite of the protagonist, who exists to bring the protagonist’s qualities out
Other secondary or tertiary characters that drive the story forward, or fill in details of the story
The Setting: where your story is happening
The Message: Why are you telling this story? What are you trying to convey? STAR moment?
The Conflict: something that happens in your story that gets in the way of your main character.
The Resolution (also sometimes called a denouement)
Craft: making sure your story is clear and doesn’t have any confusing errors or writing that’s hard to muddle through.
8. Call to Action

Story of: 
User (persona)
You (learning, problems, solutions, journey)
Listeners (learning, problems, solutions, journey)


Design Thinking Project Video (5 min):

Presenting the idea and how to solve the users (personas) problem
Compelling?
Who is it told to?
How would you influence them?
What do you need to say to influence them?
Did you start with a hook? 
Did you end with a high point?
Five minutes isn't a lot of time, jump straight in,  
Start with your problem statement: This is what somebody needed to do.
Then, take viewer through the steps of the Design Thinking process
Then say how they achieved their goal.
In the last minute tell the story for you: 
What part are you most proud of?
What's your biggest achievement?
What did you get right?
What did you really enjoy sharing as part of the story?
