Agile Development

The different activities required to develop a software solution.
How traditionally this process was performed and what challenges this approach introduced
How Agile evolved to address these challenges
Commonly used practices in Agile using features available in Github.  

What is Agile?

Different activities involved in software solution development?
Activities performed as discrete phases in the project development lifecycle (waterfall approach)
Agile Approach (new)

Software Development Activities (traditionally in specialised teams handing each phase over):
Planning
Understand Requirements 
Analyse requirements 
Clear, 
Feasible and 
Non-conflicting.  
How implemented
Testing
Evaluation (to meet initial requirements)

Waterfall Model : row of development phases
26% Successful
53% Challenged
21% Failed

Agile Approach:
Iterative method 
Incremental cycles of software development where all activities are done repeatedly in small loops.
Focus on: 
increased collaboration and  human interaction between the team and with users,
less documentation, 
greater team autonomy, 
early and continuous delivery, 
adaptive planning, 
evolutionary development… and more.

Benefits of Agile:

We receive better value on time and effort investment. 
We do not perform intensive upfront planning and design for features that might never be used or removed. 
We only perform planning and design for one cycle at a time. 
We can ensure constant evaluation and verification with final users or customers.
We receive feedback and can make adjustments early in the process.
A bug or misunderstood requirement does not get baked into the code, such that it will require rework to a released software product.  
Consistent evaluation dramatically reduces the risk of any misunderstanding. 
Users and customers with the flexibility to change, update, and prioritise the requirements from cycle to cycle.
Flexibility enables the development team to re-align with business priorities 
Team can deliver better value to solution users.
Avoid pushing testing toward the end of the project and compromise it to meet the deadline.
Ensures delivery of a quality software solution.
In contrast to the Waterfall approach,  people are core to the Agile culture.
Development team is empowered to participate in feature discussions and to self manage their work.
Collaboration and open communication across boundaries are highly encouraged.
“Different teams” replaced with one team called “The Agile Team.
Shares a common goal of a useful working solution, the ultimate success measurement. 
The development team’s morale and sense of ownership are usually very high in work environments where an Agile approach is adopted. 
Standish Group - Chaos Report, the Agile approach to software solutions development has a noticeably higher success rate than the Waterfall approach.

## The Agile Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.

Agile Values
Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan

Keep processes that attend to all of the above, and discard those that don’t.
Remembering that plans change.


Agile Principles: 
(how to put values into practice)

Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early, continuous and frequent delivery of valuable software.
Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
Collaborate Daily: business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
Build projects around motivated individuals.
Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
Working software is the primary measure of progress.
Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
Technical Debt : the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.
Simplicity--the art of maximising the amount of work not done--is essential.
The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organising teams.
At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly.

Agile Frameworks: 
Scrum 
Extreme Programming (XP)
Lean
Kanban
Rational Unified Process RUP
Crystal
Dynamic Systems Development Method DSDM
Feature Driven Development FDD

Key Concepts:

Incremental Development
Bite size features added to 
Minimal effort
Least dev time possible
Avoid programming functionality until needed
(Don’t waste effort on unnecessary functions)

Iterative Development
Repeated cycles of work / development 
1 - 4  weeks 
Opportunity for user feedback 
Opportunity to review and evaluate


Build-Measure-Learn
(reassessment of features usually involves analysing):
Structure,
Modularity, 
Usability, 
Reliability, 
Efficiency, & 
Achievement of goals.

Project Constraints
Boundaries surrounding projects
Cost 
Time
Scope
Quality

Suppose you have a customer who requested you build a software solution. As a result of your requirements gathering and analysis, you identified fifty features to be implemented as the scope of the project.

Based on this, and after multiple cycles of negotiation, you completed estimations and the project schedule. The project will take two months and will cost the customer $50K.

As you progress, the customer discovers that one of the main features was overlooked. Without this feature, the application will not be useful and expected business outcomes will be serverly affected.

Based on what you learned so far:
How would you tackle this dilemma? How can you address the situation without impacting the solution quality?
Discuss scope, time, and cost associated with this
Which constraints should the customer and development teams think about differently?
All 
Which Agile values and principles support your argument?
Values: 
Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan

Principles: 
early and continuous delivery
harness change for the customer's competitive advantage
Deliver working software frequently
work together daily
projects around motivated individuals
conveying information face-to-face
Working software is the primary measure of progress
be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely
Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility
Simplicity is essential (the art of maximizing the amount of work not done)
self-organizing teams
Give time at regular intervals, to reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjust behavior accordingly


Agile Approach to Constraints:

In a Waterfall project, as we usually start with scope, scope is king! As a result, we have to implement all the features specified by the user. This bias towards the customer’s perspective puts massive pressure on the development team!  As the development team mainly manages quality, we tend to sacrifice it! This risks producing a defective solution, and an unhappy customer!

## Agile Roles:
Business People (User, Customer)
clarify the requirements, 
provide priorities for work, 
verify the completed work is completed and up to standard, and 
provide timely constructive feedback to the development team to reflect and adjust.

Product Owner [Non-Technical]
Representative of the Users Voice to the development team
Setting the direction for the development team.
Shares the customer’s vision of the end  product or software solution with the team.
Works with the customer to collect and understand the customer’s needs and requirements.
Works with the development team to prioritise the work for the next iteration based on feedback and changing business needs.
Ensures that product development translates into value for the users, therefore, communication with users, business people and the development team is a key responsibility.

Close collaboration between Product Owner, Business People and Dev Team

Development Team [Techies] (Product Owner, Software Developers, User Interface engineers, testers)
Develop the software solution
Strive to have a team with all the skills required to develop the solution, without any  dependencies on individuals outside the team.
Crucial that the team is fully  self-organised and self-managed.
Thus the team collectively decide who works on what and
What effort is required  to complete a work item.
Encourage the development team members to be multi-skilled professionals so that their skill set enables the team to gel.
must also have soft skills such as negotiation, listening and conflict management skills.  
When an issue occurs, the team is both capable and empowered to  take corrective actions within the team and
Able to discuss the implications and alternatives with the business people.


The Agile Team: (Development Team, Product Owners, Business People)
All individuals who perform the necessary technical and non-technical capabilities related to developing the software solution. 
All agile team members will focus their effort on achieving that goal.
Agile is not prescriptive, different Agile methodologies have evolved and every methodology has its  own set of roles and defined responsibilities.

Ultimate measure of progress and success is having a working solution regardless of the role

## Agile Practices 

User Stories 
Articulate the value proposition for the work and drive the development work.
A small, self-contained unit of development work designed to accomplish a specific goal within a product.
Written by users / product owners to represent the user’s perspective
Provide user focused framework for daily activity = Driver for collaboration and creativity
Constitutes the smallest single unit of work in an an agile process

Describe the value expected from the feature
Detailed once implementation is due
Detailed in collaboration with development team

Epics
Large items that cannot fit into a single iteration, but can be broken into user stories.

Sign-in feature (Epic),
User story: sign-in with username and password,
User story: sign-in with Facebook,
User story: “Forgot password” functionality,
…

Theme
Convenient way to indicate that a set of related epics have something in common, such  as being in the same functional area.

Account Management (Theme)
Sign-in feature (Epic)
User profile feature (Epic)
Sign-up feature (Epic)
…

Ensure that  the development team’s day-to-day work contributes to the business goals built into epics and themes.



* As a <role> I can <capability>,  so that <receive benefit>, or 
In order to <receive benefit>  as a <role>, I can <goal/desire>


### The 3 C’s;  
Card
A brief story:
“As a warehouse employee, I can select the paper size on which to print so that the printed label  size matches the parcel size.”
Conversation begins to detail the requirements needed. 
Allows the development team to ask questions to ensure they clearly understand what’s being asked for and the value being provided.* What details should be included in the print-out? 
What are the various paper sizes?
Should we show a “preview” version before printing?
In contrast to the Waterfall process, In agile, the requirements evolve from this process, as a result of a 2-way discussion. 
  

Confirmation* Development team needs to confirm that they understand the User Story.
* They also need to get confirmation from the  customer regarding the acceptance criteria of the User Story

Acceptance criteria
Subjectively confirms that the work on a particular user story is completed. an invaluable opportunity for  collaboration between the Development Team and customer or Product Owner.

Clear 
Objective 
Measurable

User Story: 
As a warehouse employee, I can select the paper size on which to print so that the printed label size matches the parcel size.
Acceptance Criteria: 
Order details must include the order id, the shipping address and the list of items in the parcel
The warehouse employee is able to select the size  of the order details from 3 sizes (A4, A5 and A6).
The font size used is 12 point.

The acceptance criteria consist of the requirements of the user story. By using these criteria,  the product owner or customer, and the development team, will all know how to identify exactly when this user story is complete.


GitHub Issues enable you to keep track and manage the issues (user stories) in your projects.
Sample Answer:
 
User stories are bite-size increments that build up a complete feature. When articulating user stories, strive to make the effort as small as possible, yet with a clear value proposition. For our project, we can consider “Home Page Poll” as an Epic consisting of many user stories.
According to our description, we have 2 main roles. The Website administrators, who will post the poll and track the results, and the users or runners who will respond to the poll.

Let’s take “Submit a Poll Response” as a feature and create some example related user stories.

These 3 related user stories, will build the complete feature of “Submitting a Poll Response”. They incrementally build the feature and each one has a clear value proposition.

Similarly, for the Website Administrator, we might have different features “Create a Poll”, “Manage a Poll”, and “Publish a Poll”. Let’s take “Publish a Poll” and articulate some user stories:

Note: You might argue that we can have them as one story, where we publish and define the expiry date in one story. However, remember that we try to build the “minimum” possible feature, then we increment it with more user stories. Also the value proposition for “publishing a poll” and “Adding Expiry” is different.

While publishing would help collect users feedback, adding an expiry date will help the administrator better manage the appearance of the poll on the home page.

#### User Story Tasks 

The various individual activities carried out by the development team to implement a User Story as “Tasks”. 

The development team is responsible for identifying, assigning, and tracking tasks’ progress. 
They take all the technical decisions required to deliver various User Stories




User Story: 
As a warehouse employee, I can select the paper size on which to print so that the printed label size matches the parcel size.
Acceptance Criteria: 
Order details must include the order id, the shipping address and the list of items in the parcel
The warehouse employee is able to select the size  of the order details from 3 sizes (A4, A5 and A6).
The font size used is 12 point.

Tasks: 
Design a “print” icon and add it to the order details page.
Design the print layouts for the different page sizes.
Create the HTML and CSS for the dropdown menu including the paper sizes. 
Create the code for the model, viewer and controller.
Test the completed functionality.
Common practice when writing tasks:1. Verbs instead of nouns
2. Ideally sized (not too small or big)
3. May use technical terms
4. Cover the acceptance criteria


User Story Estimation 
Predict over short term iterations
Team collaboration and communication to control workflow
Responsibility of development team to estimate

Ideal time?? Not easy to estimate - usually fails to incorporate distractions and other activities such as meetings, events and urgent defect fixes
Story Points: Relative estimations : 1 story point vs 2 story points
Task 'A' will take twice as much effort as another task, which we’re using as our benchmark value.
Story Points are focused on the amount of work done, not how long it took.
Humans better at relative estimations
Usually use a non-linear scale for story points estimation
The Modified Fibonacci series and 
The Doubling Score



#### Team Velocity and Release Date.How to predict overall time to release

Calculate Team Velocity
Use Team Velocity to calculate Release Date

Team Velocity: 
On average, how many story points the development team can manage to finish in one iteration of a particular length.

After running a few iterations, we can begin to get a more realistic understanding of how much work is being completed in each iteration.  And because each iteration is of equal length, you can now begin to predict with a higher level of certainty how many story points, on average, the development team can finish per iteration in the future. This is the team velocity value.

Iteration 1 = 21 Story Points
Iteration 2 = 19 Story Points
Iteration 3 = 20 Story Points

Average = 20 Story Points = Average Team Velocity

Predicted Release Date (of the solution):1. Estimate the total story points for all of the targeted user stories, then;
2. Divide this number by the team velocity,  
Target user stories estimation = 200 story points
Team velocity after 2 Iterations = 25 story points. 
# of iterations = 200 / 25 = 8 iterations
Given: Iteration Duration = 2 weeks 
Predicted Release Date = 8 iterations x 2 weeks = 16 Weeks
Changes welcomed - thus changes in predictions expected.




To predict the release date, let’s follow the steps we illustrated in the lesson:
Target user stories Estimation: 14 Story points
Team velocity: This is given as 8 story points
# of iterations required : 14/8 = 1.75 which means we need 2 iterations.
Given a duration of 2 weeks per iteration, 
Expected to release the target stories after 4 weeks.


### Product Backlog 
A centralised prioritised list of the work items the development team may deliver for the customer. It contains all work that may deliver value to the customer from the software solution. Uses as a single authoritative source that drives the development team’s work.

‘Milestones’ in GitHub

Work Items (Product Backlog Items” or PBI’s): 
requests for new user stories,
higher-level ideas in the form of epics, or
general suggestions for enhancements, as well as,
reports of issues and defects in the solution
Dynamic (backlog refinement): add PBIs, remove them, break them down and re-prioritize them based on previous cycles’ feedback.  
Main point of reference
To present status of work

#### Product Backlog Refinement (grooming)
Crucial to ensure that there is enough work that adds value ready for the development team to work on (User Stories or Defects). 
To ensure that we always deliver the most critical PBIs first
Continuous refinement due to flexibility of change

Verify new requests, suggestions and defects and record them in the backlog in light of their alignment with the business objectives.
Discuss and refine PBIs and user stories. Might need to split a story or epic into multiple user stories, or get more details for a certain story using the 3Cs process discussed previously.
Estimate the amount of effort needed to complete each PBI.
Continuously reprioritise PBIs.  
changes in business directions, 
new requirements or crucial defects identified
remove items that are not valid any more  


Product Owner role 
(“Product Manager”,  “Product Champion”, “Senior Customer”, “Product  Director” and “Value Manager”)
Importance to drive the development work and maximise the value created by the development team.
identify and describe the PBIs to build a shared understanding of the problem and a solution for each PBI within the development team. 
Decide on the priorities of the PBIs to deliver - the maximum outcome with the minimum effort. 
Once a user story is completed by the development team, the product owner makes the final decision as to whether the user story is delivered per acceptance criteria.
Serve as a single source of information to ensure the development team is focused.
reducing churn resulting from waiting for answers, conflicting priorities, and by addressing  any concerns. 



Prioritisation
Vital to identify the PBI’s to be completed to deliver the most crucial work first

Time-boxingA hard stop for planned work to evaluate and reflect

Not estimated based on the effort required to complete the work, but a future point in time to stop and reflect
Never extended to accommodate the work initially planned for completion within that timebox.
Iteration = timebox

Benefits:
Earlier return on investment.
Immediate start on value-add activities.
Better focus on the time box’s goal - the timebox can not be extended.
Customer see’s increased value with each iteration
Culture of build, measure, learn instilled
Timeboxing applied on all levels (iterations, meetings, projects)

In gitHub: milestones with time boundary

MoSCow Prioritisation
Assign priorities for Product Backlog Items to be completed in a particular time box i.e. iteration

Must Have - non negotiable (core, legal, security)
Should Have - if work around available, not vital. Add significant value. (Performance improvements, minor defects fixes, new functionality).
Could Have - delivered in their entirety in a best-case scenario. When a problem occurs and the deadline is at risk, one or more “could-have” items are dropped.
Won’t Have - Agile team has agreed that the PBI wouldn’t be delivered. Possible reschedule to later iterations? Recorded to manage expectations always.

Usually, business people tend to push everything as “Must-Have”:

Team to collaboratively agree on the split of effort between “Must Have” “Should Have”, and “Could Have” in each iteration.
Plan enough contingency to ensure confidence in a successful project outcome.
Must haves <60%
Could Haves (20%)
Should Haves (the rest)
Priority is always relative to the remaining PBIs (ie priorities reset in each iteration).
GitHub Labels

Burndown Charts
To show how quickly the development team burns through the user stories.
Y = User Points
X = Days


If we plot this as a burndown chart it will be as below

The end of week one, marks the 5th day. As we have completed the first story, the remaining effort will be 5 story points. Remember that we only deduct the User Story points once the development of the user story is complete. As we are in the middle of the 2nd user story points, we will not deduct its estimation. our chart should be as below.
Since by the end of week 1 the amount of actual remaining work exceeds the amount of planned remaining work, we are behind schedule.
