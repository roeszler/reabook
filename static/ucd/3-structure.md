# Project X - UCD Structure Plane

_This section is for display purposes only and has not been completed as parth of CI Project X - Project X. It is included as an initial template only and is intended as a quick refrence for use within projects in the future._

## 3 of 5 Planes - Structure
--- 
The structure plane is concerned with the organisation of your functionality and content and how to navigate in an intuitive way through your content and features.
- How do we get to a particular location?
- Where do we go once we get there?

_Navigation is key - (never rely on fwd / back buttons)_

- What categories of information do we need?
- What is the best way to present this information?

_Strives for organisation and presentation that is intuitive_

- Linear narrative
  - Simple
  - Can be restrictive

 - Non-Linear
   - Flexible
   - Possibly confusing

_Choose the structure for your audience & your culture_
- For demographic
- For users

### Interaction Design (IXD)
---
is responsible for defining the structure and the behaviour of interactive systems.

- Creates meaningful relationships within 
  - Elements, 
  - Content, and 
  - Information

- Communicates functionality and interactivity
- Reveals workflows
- Reduces the risk of user error
- Makes users aware of state changes on the system

#### __IXD Ensures site is:__
- Consistent
- Learnable
- Predictable
- Visible
- Feedback is clear and intuitive

#### Consistency
- Scenarios behave the same 
- Leverage the visitor's prior experience
- Labels and terms should be the same throughout the experience.
- Content and imagery should have a stable, consistent style.

_Only be different when it makes something better_

#### Learnable
- Intuitive = Single-trial learning
- Users come pre-trained in certain aspects. Use them.
- Don't distract from the primary purpose of your application
- Can user answer
  - Where am I?
  - How did I get here?
  - What can I do here?
  - Where can I go from here?

#### Predictable
- Yes to the above (learnable)?
- Provides a strong sense of place, 
- That we have set the correct expectations, 
- Made it possible for people to accurately predict the outcome of their interactions.

#### Visible
- Discoverable 
- No looking involved
- Content hinting (reveal partial content)

#### Feedback Provided
- A clearly visible change of state from actions / errors
- Clear indications of state change
- Return to safety links

### Information Architecture 
---
is responsible for the creation of organisation and navigational schemas

#### Types of IA
- Tree Structure
  - Standard
  - You navigate and traverse down and up through the tree
  - Can be problematic on mobile devices
    - Overcome by convention of using the Burger icon as a representation of your navigation elements collapsed into a single icon

- Nested List
  - A linear path to detail
  - Well-suited to mobile devices
  - Being a very defined path to a location; 
    - it can prevent exploring

- Hub & Spoke
  - Central home with links to spokes containing subsections of information
  - must come back to hub to access another spoke

- Dashboard
  - central home with panels containing summary of information that expand to reveal more detailed info
  - better suited to desktop applications

#### Good IA

- Allows users to efficiently move through content and 
- Be easily educated and informed as they do so
- Allows owners to accommodate growth and change

#### Organising principles
- Geography?
- Audience? 
- Product?

---

Rules of thumb:

- The organising principles used at the highest levels of the site should be the most closely tied to user needs and business objectives.
- Lower level principles influenced by feature specifications and content requirements.
- Every collection has a built in conceptual structure, and in most cases, it has more than one.
- The hard part is creating the right structure for your objectives and the user's needs
- Information Architecture split from Visual Vocabulary in bigger teams
