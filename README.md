## 2. Agile Development Process

This project (SpaceScope) has been developed following an Agile methodology. As part of the assessment process at the [Code Institutes](https://codeinstitute.net/) - [Full Stack development program](https://codeinstitute.net/se/full-stack-software-development-diploma/). 

SpaceScope has not been created within a team, rather the efforts of the main author, [Stuart Roeszler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stuartroeszler/). As such some of the project management processes such as [team velocity](#team-velocity) and [information radiators](#information-radiators) are outlined only, however would form a crucial part of a live, team based project.
